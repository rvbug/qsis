# Quantum Spacetime Intelligence System (QSIS)

# Concepts

- Special Relativity Basics (you’re already doing this!)
- Lorentz factor γ.
- Time dilation.
- Length contraction.
- Relativistic velocity addition
- Visualisation Ideas
- Minkowski spacetime diagrams (can plot proper time vs dilated time).
- Light cones (foundation for Closed Timelike Curves / CTCs later).
- Path to Time Travel Concepts
- General Relativity (curved spacetime, geodesics).
- Closed Timelike Curves (Gödel universe, Tipler cylinder).
- Wormholes (Morris–Thorne solutions).
- Quantum aspects (entanglement, decoherence, chronology protection).


# Future Roadmap
- Auto-simulation mode (graphs sweep velocity without input).
- Velocity Addition (how two observers in motion combine speeds relativistically).
- Minkowski diagram visualisation.
- Research side: once you’re comfy, move from special relativity into curved spacetime + CTC models.
